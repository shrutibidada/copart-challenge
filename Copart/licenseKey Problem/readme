The Problem:

We are given a string S consisting of N characters and an integer K. The string represents software license key which we would like to format. The string is composed of alphanumeric characters and dashes. The dashes split the string into groups (i.e if there are M dashes, the string is split into M+1 groups). The dashes in the string are possibly misplaced.

We want each group of characters to be of the length K (except for possibly the first group which could be shorter). All lowercase letters must be converted to uppercase.

The Input: Enter string S and integer K or pass them as args

The Output: Formatted license key according to the rules

Sample Input: S=2-4A0r7-4k K=4

Sample Output: 24A0-R74K

To Do:

The code is a java program. 
Run the program and enter the inputs accordigly.
